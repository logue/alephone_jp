The Pfhor learned early on in the war that Pfhor fighters with weak energy melee weapons stood little chance against a well greased assault rifle.  Since then, they've placed an increased focus on small, agile attack drones.  The wide spread of even the most modern AR makes destroying these drones before they inflict significant damage a very difficult task, as I'm sure you've discovered.

Does killing all of these little flying mechanisms remind you of my slight mishap with the $IMarathon's$i low-flying defense drones?

It'll relieve you to know that I've gotten much better with automated defense system modification since then.  A little more work, and I'll be able to seize control of remote units just like the ones you're having so much difficulty with.

Then again, I wouldn't want you getting lazy on me.

I've decoded the latest prisoner manifest and it confirms that Admiral Carroway is alive and that his transport is under the personal supervision of Pfhor Honor guard.

According to these logs, the Admiral is being taken to an ad-hoc prison in a nearby mining facility.  I wouldn't be surprised if this were $ITycho's $iidea; underground, it will be difficult for the UESC to pinpoint his location or mount an effective attack.

I'm sending you to the southern entrance to the mines.  You'll have to find a way in on your own, as the Pfhor have sealed off the main entry to the complex from the inside.  Once you get into the mine, open the bay doors so that the UESC can move in with heavy fusion cutting machines.

Time to go for a little side trip, friend.  Be warned - the level you will be taken to is much harder than this one.  Press 'escape' now if you'd like to stay here instead.

Not gone yet?  Suit yourself.  Let's see how you do.
