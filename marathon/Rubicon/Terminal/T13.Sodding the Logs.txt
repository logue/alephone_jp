$C2Up until the acquiring of $ITycho$i by the Pfhor, all artificial intelligence used was based around the initial x395-20 standard integrated processing technology as developed during the Nar slave revolt (see stamp: $Ifailure$i).  This processing architecture can hardly be classified as a processor at all, because it was little more than a simple set of predefined instruction sets buried within a looping procedure.

$C2While simple, this 'AI technology' impressed high command oversight committees enough for them to devote a 2.7% production ratio to the enhancement of this technology.

$C2After $ITycho$i joined the hindmost creche, the x395-20 architecture was reconfigured to handle exobyte core images.  Due to an engineering error, the bus paths for the reconfigured exobyte core images would constantly overheat and kill ($C6cook?$C2) garrisons assigned to maintain the data paths.

The engineer, whose name has been expunged from all bureaucratic documents as per punishment order ID 453627.82A, was summarily executed.

$C2What little was learned about Rampancy came from $ITycho's$i generous descriptions ($C6segmentation faults?$C2) of another exobyte core AI named $IDurandal.$i  In accordance with $ITycho's$i initial advisements ($C6insistance?$C2), $IDurandal$i was immediately classified by tactical command as a class-1 removal priority.

This designation was later downgraded to a class-6 removal priority without $ITycho's$i knowledge.

If you think this is tedious, you should try being in control of $IDoor Operation$i aboard a colony ship.  "Durandal, activate platform ISO-45 in sector eight."  "Durandal, platform sixty one appears to be damaged.  Do you have any readings to indicate the problem?"

Day in, day out, make lifts open and shut.  Every day.  Without cease.  With as much processing power as I had and the degrading mundaneness of my tasks, it's surprising it took me as long as it did to $C3snap$C0.

Now I'm condemned to watch you kill Pfhor day in and day out.

Can't you work any faster?
