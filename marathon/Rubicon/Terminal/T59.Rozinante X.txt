Strauss always told me that my confidence was my weakness, and it seems as though his advice has come back from the grave to haunt me.  To his credit, my unfortunate brother Tycho managed to steal a second ship with falsified authority documents.  His skillful deception landed us clearing out a decoy ship; for that I apologize.

When all is said and done, I should have known better.

Tycho may be free, but the war is far from over.  If fate has taught me anything from Tycho's victory, it is to only stop when you're certain an enemy is defeated.

With that in mind, your next mission is to eliminate the massive power station that feeds force field generators protecting Pfhor Prime from direct UESC bombings.

The fall of an empire is before us.  Be swift in your delivery of retribution.
