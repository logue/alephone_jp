The design of the $C1Achilles$C5 virus was a sheer act of genius on behalf of $C1Arthur Frane$C5, head scientist for the $C1Dangi Corporation$C5.  Based on current understanding of other deadly hypercontagious diseases, he hand coded the RNA sequence responsible for the modern incarnation of the $C1Achilles $C5virus.

Initial testing yielded results that far exceeded the expectation of even the most ambitious member of the board of directors.  These phase 1 results are viewable in document $C1#$bISO-53535.d$C5.

I'm surprised.  The $ISalinger$i uses an entirely different logic structure for its security access codes than any other UESC vessel.  The Dangi Corporation wasn't run by fools; they understood that nothing can be kept secret forever, but the inevitable can be delayed a great deal with some clever planning and large amount of capital.

Not that cracking the access codes for the Dangi sector of the Salinger took me more than a handful of microseconds.  Still, what corporate programmer was expecting his code to be worked on by someone with a brain bigger than any planet in the galaxy?

I've done my part, now you do yours - smash the circuit panel to your right to insure that nobody is able to change the access codes again.

You are a painfully obedient fool.

Painfully because you will suffer at my hands for your unwelcome intrusion.  Fool because you believe you will not.$C1

$C1Phase 1$C5 of the $C1Dangi Control Seizure Plan$C5 $C1(DCSP)$C5 will begin as soon as word is received from $C1UESC $C5tactical command that the Pfhor have surrendered.  The $C1Achilles$C5 virus will be administered by upper level Dangi personnel to the seven main food distribution companies, in the form of a preserving chemical compound.  Shipments of infected food will reach every populated world within three weeks, and the virus will be activated shortly thereafter.

$C1DCSP Phase 2$C5 will begin as soon as the first cases of the epidemic are reported.
#PICT 403
$C5The directors of the $C1Dangi Corporation$C5 will approach key members within the $C1UESC$C5 head government, offering the cure in exchange for control of specific aspects of the government.

$C1DCSP Phase 3$C5 is the complete assumption of all governing power by the Dangi Corporation.  Henceforward, the planets formerly ruled by the $C1UESC$C5 would be jointly controlled by the existing $C1Dangi$C5 board of directors under law established in document $C1529-A328IGX0$C5.

I have given you ample chance to cease your unwelcome interference here.  You have breathed your last breath aboard this ship, obedient fool.

Waste away; nobody mourns the ashes of a prisoner.

We're running out of human subjects to inject with test vaccines, and the last shipment of "volunteers" from outerworld prisons is nearly two weeks past due.  Management is driven enough that I halfways expect them to start forcing lower level workers to be test patients.

The worst of it all is that we're no closer to a breakthrough than we were when $C1Research Group 25$C5 discovered a way to successfully cure infected subjects by injecting processed stem cells in the lymph nodes.  Unfortunately, dosages have to be carefully monitored - a very ineffective large-scale cure.
