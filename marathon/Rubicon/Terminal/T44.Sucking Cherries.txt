Hang in there - I believe the UESC is sending in some troopers to help you out. Mind whom you shoot though; they still aren't sure which side you're on.

I have found out what sort of process Lysander started; the assembly of the new line of Autonomous Military Dangi Droids (AMDDs).  I've already shut it down, but not before somewhere between 150 and 200 AMDDs were cranked out.  You've already met some of them, I gather.

Quit complaining.  If the AMDDs had been beyond prototype and the mass assembly line had been completed, you'd be taking on a hundred times the number.

Leela would be proud of you.

She always had a special thing for you, her knight in shining armor.  After nigh-singlehandedly saving the $IMarathon$i and rescuing its colonists from the harsh life of a subservient Pfhor slave race, it's little wonder she wanted to keep you all for herself.
#PICT 24


Then again, I can hardly blame her.  We've accomplished so much since then... if you had stayed with her, wouldn't you have missed reading my rampant poetic messages to you in the dark halls of the $IMarathon$i, or our resurrection of the eleventh S'pht clan and crippling of Battle Group Seven?

I've tried to keep you busy, and Leela would've probably returned you to guard duty in some outerworld colony.

The Achilles virus was the Pfhor empire's very last chance of winning the war.  I've received word that the Pfhor have surrendered in the hope of keeping at least their own system.  This surrender must have taken place almost as soon as news of their failure here reached Pfhor Prime.

No rest for the weary, however; you and I are needed far from that toppling empire.  Ancient S'pht myth has long foretold the existence of a great tear connecting another reality to our own.  I already know where our search will begin.

See you in no time, old friend.

This wasn't where I wanted you to end up. Not that I expected that teleport to go through flawlessly, under the stress the station is currently experiencing.  I'm surprised the situation isn't worse, considering the pummeling the Salinger has received in the past standard day or so. The lack of a stable AI onboard doesn't make things any better.

Since you're here, you may as well have a look around.  My sensors tell me that a lot of fighting is going on not too far away from your current location.

Have fun.

$C4$B-Scott Brown$C7$b, for being such a picky bastard. If it wasn't for him the monsters of Rubicon would have been of the "it looks good if you squint" quality.

$C4$B-Sean Wallich$C7$b, for giving us server space for what must have felt like forever to someone that young. ;)

$C6My part in $C2Rubicon$C6 started back in $C21996$C6 when, impressed by the work of other mapmakers, I decided to make a scenario of my own.  I turned out to be a frankly crappy mapmaker, and then the long string of team members and mergers began.  What you're playing now is the end result of at least three scenarios and dozens of contributors.

Most of the work was done by $C2Chris Lund$C6 and $C2D. Scott Brown$C6, as I had few applicable skills.  Props also to my dad, who let me use his computer until I got my own and $C2ig98$C6 who ran the Hotline server.

Hope you enjoyed $C2Rubicon$C6.  Please send fan/hate mail.  Just so long as we know you're playing.

$bYou should be thankful that the remaining Pfhor have decided to join the battle; they've done a lot of your dirty work for you.  The Pfhor and the AMDDs have been busily massacring each other all over the Dangi sector.  Some of it has spilled into the UESC sector as well, but the UESC seems to be capable of cleaning up that bit on their own.

If you're curious about where the fresh Pfhor units are teleporting in from, I discovered a small scoutship that evaded my sensors earlier.  It was concealed in the debris of the $IN'far'l$i. 

I'm taking care of the situation, right...

$C7When we ($C4Jeff Schwartz$C7,$C4 Chris Wondra$C7,$C4 Tim Thomas $C7and $C4I$C7) made these levels, we made them so they would be challenging for us, so we wouldn't be able to stroll through the levels blindfolded.

As it turned out, this was too tough for the betatesters.  Way too tough.  They completed the levels by cheating or by playing on kindergarden, swearing at the mapmakers every time they had their posteriour handed to them.

So the monsters had to be pruned (meaning$C3 $C420-25%$C3 $C7of the monsters are gone in most levels), and the result are levels that won't kill you before your feet hit the ground.$C0
