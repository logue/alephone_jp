Carroway is safe in UESC hands once again, as is the fate of the war.

Unfortunately, if I learned anything during my time as a UESC AI, it was that humanity is never to be trusted with its own destiny.

The Dangi Corporation, the largest privately held organization in the human economy (and the least well known, I might add) owns a significant portion of the $ISalinger$i, a top secret remote UESC weapons research facility.  From what I've been able to gather from the encoded distress signal I intercepted only a few seconds ago, things have gone very awry aboard Salinger.

I'm bringing you back aboard the $IRozinante$i, where you should gear up for your next mission.  I hope to have more details about the situation aboard the Salinger when you arrive.

Admiral Carroway is currently being held in a converted ore sample crusher somewhere in this underground sector of the mine.  That's right - an ore sample crusher - the kind that turns big giant rocks into lots of little tiny rocks, and would likely turn one normal sized Admiral into a much compressed and no-longer-living pancake.

Tycho obviously means business, and it's a wonder that he hasn't killed Carroway yet.  Maybe he's keeping Carroway seconds away from death to tease me.  Maybe he's just a nutcase.

Regardless, you'll need to move quickly as soon as you break into Carroway's holding area.  Tycho will likely try to kill him as soon as he discovers that you're close, so you must hurry and smash any circuits you see that are near Carroway's makeshift cell.

Hopefully you'll be able to disable the ore crusher before Tycho has the chance to put it to use.  Good luck.

$C1In case any of you wanted to know, the original design of this level was such that no matter what, Carroway died.  On top of that, the player was always the one who had to kill him.  Pretty silly, right?

Basically the setup was similar to what it is now, except that there was a switch (no wires, just a switch) next to the admiral's cell.  The player *had* to throw that switch in order to be allowed to leave, and that switch activated the crusher on top of Carroway.

Just a little historical note for you.

              Love & kisses,

Did I not tell you to destroy any controls you might find?

Your failure to do as told is unfortunate.
We now have to extend our stay on this backwards world, for without Carroway the incompetent leaders of the UESC will no doubt run their war machine into the ground.

It now becomes our regrettable burden to eliminate Tycho and the Pfhor threat on our own.

You, of course, will be doing most of the legwork.
