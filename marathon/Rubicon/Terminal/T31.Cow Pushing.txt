$C4Lutefisk$C7 is made from air-dried whitefish (normally cod), prepared with lye, in a sequence of particular treatments. The first treatment is to soak the stockfish in cold water for five to six days (changed daily). The saturated stockfish is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days. The fish will swell during this soaking, regaining a size even bigger than the original (undried) fish, but the protein content paradoxically decreases by more than 50 percent, causing its famous jelly-like consistency. When this treatment is finished, the fish (saturated with lye) has a pH value of 11Ð12, and is therefore corrosive. To make the fish edible, a final treatment of yet another four to six days (and nights) of soaking in cold water (also changed daily) is needed. Eventually, the lutefisk is ready to be cooked.

In Finland, the traditional reagent used is birch ash. It contains high amount of potassium carbonate and hydrocarbonate, giving the fish more mellow treatment than sodium hydroxide (lyestone). It is important not to incubate the fish too long in the lye, because saponification of the fish fats may occur, effectively rendering the fish fats into soap. The term for such spoiled fish is saippuakala (soap fish).
#INFORMATION
$C7After the preparation, the lutefisk is saturated with water and must therefore be cooked carefully so it does not fall into pieces. It does not need any additional water for the cooking; it is enough to place it in a pan, salt it, seal the lid tightly, and let it steam cook under a very low heat for 20Ð25 minutes. It is also possible to do this in the oven. The fish is then put in an ovenproof dish, covered with aluminium foil, and baked at 225Ê¡C (435 ¡F) for 40Ð50 minutes.
When cooking and eating lutefisk, it is important to clean the lutefisk off of pans, plates, and utensils right away. Lutefisk left overnight becomes nearly impossible to remove.

Lutefisk is usually served with a variety of side dishes, including, but not limited to, bacon, green pea stew, potatoes, meatballs, gravy, mashed rutabaga, white sauce, syrup, geitost (goat cheese), or "old" cheese (gammelost). Especially in the U.S., it is usually eaten with lefse. Even if the common denominator is lutefisk, side dishes vary greatly from family to family and region to region, and is a theme of recurring controversy when different "traditions" of lutefisk-eaters meet and eat together.

Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations.  It shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble because of language and cultural differences.  For example...



$C5
 
 $C1Scandinavian$C5 vacuum manufacturer $C1Electrolux$C5 used the following in an American ad campaign:  $C1"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux."$C5
#PICT 527

 The name $C1Coca-Cola$C5 in $C1China$C5 was first rendered as $C1Ke-kou-ke-la$C5.  Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means $C1"bite the wax tadpole"$C5 or $C1"female horse stuffed with wax"$C5 depending on the dialect.  Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, $C1"ko-kou-ko-le,"$C5 which can be loosely translated as
 $C1"happiness in the mouth."$C5
 
 In $C1Taiwan$C5, the translation of the $C1Pepsi$C5 slogan $C1"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation"$C5 came out as $C1"Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead."$C5
 
 Also in $C1Chinese$C5, the $C1Kentucky Fried Chicken$C5 slogan $C1"finger-lickin' good"$C5 came out as $C1"eat your fingers off."$C5

 The $C1American$C5 slogan for $C1Salem cigarettes$C5, $C1"Salem - Feeling Free,"$C5 got translated in the $C1Japanese$C5 market into $C1"When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty."$C5
 
 When $C1General Motors$C5 introduced the $C1Chevy Nova$C5 in $C1South America$C5, it was apparently unaware that $C1"no va"$C5 means $C1"it won't go."$C5 After the company figured out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its
 $C1Spanish$C5 markets to the $C1Caribe$C5.
 
 $C1Ford $C5had a similar problem in $C1Brazil$C5 when the $C1Pinto$C5 flopped.  The company found out that $C1Pinto$C5 was $C1Brazilian $C5slang for $C1"tiny male genitals"$C5. $C1 Ford$C5 pried all the nameplates off and substituted $C1Corcel$C5,
which means horse.

 When $C1Parker Pen$C5 marketed a ballpoint pen in $C1Mexico$C5, its ads were supposed to say $C1"It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."$C5  However, the company's mistakenly thought the spanish word $C1"embarazar"$C5
meant $C1embarrass$C5.  Instead the ads said that $C1"It wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant."$C5
 


 An $C1American$C5 T-shirt maker in $C1Miami $C5printed shirts for the spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit.  Instead of the desired $C1"I Saw the Pope"$C5 in Spanish, the shirts proclaimed $C1"I Saw the Potato."$C5
#PICT 527
$C5
 $C1Chicken-man Frank Perdue$C5's slogan, $C1"It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,"$C5 got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation.  A photo of Perdue with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over Mexico with a caption that explained $C1"It takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused."$C5
 
 $C1Hunt-Wesson$C5 introduced its $C1Big John$C5 products in $C1French Canada$C5 as $C1Gros Jos$C5 before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means $C1"big breasts." $C5 In this case, however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales.
 
 $C1Colgate$C5 introduced a toothpaste in $C1France$C5 called $C1Cue$C5, the name of a notorious porno mag.
#PICT 527
$C5
 In $C1Italy$C5, a campaign for $C1Schweppes Tonic Water$C5 translated the name into $C1Schweppes Toilet Water$C5.
 
 $C1Japan$C5's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex tours.  Upon finding out why, the owners of $C1Kinki Nippon Tourist
Company$C5 changed its name.
