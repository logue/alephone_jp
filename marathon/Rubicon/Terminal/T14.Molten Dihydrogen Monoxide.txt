The T'fa'ral mining facility was once the pride and joy of the Pfhor homeworld - the infrastructure you see all around you is only the tip of the iceberg.  The actual facility extends thousands of kilometers underground, deep enough in some areas to require mining operators to equip themselves with specially pressurized suits.

Unfortunately, bureaucratic ambitions once again outpaced the technical expertise of Pfhor engineers, and large sections of the mine were eventually shut down due to safety concerns and the resultant deaths of several thousand mining workers.

All of this isn't very comforting news for Admiral Carroway or the detachment of UESC troops sent to rescue him... the environmental hazards are likely to kill more men than the Pfhor do.

Good work.  The UESC has already teleported a small detachment of experienced marines to the bay door opening.  This rescue party is going deeper underground in an attempt to find Admiral Carroway and flush out his captors.

I'm piggybacking your teleport signal on top of theirs.  You need to help them explore the mine and find the Admiral.

This is the control terminal for the south blast door.  Unfortunately, $C3Tycho$C0 had the forethought to disable any kind of manual operation of the door, and it's unlikely that we'll be able to open it via this terminal.

From what I've gathered of the structural plans for this facility, the south blast door is controlled by a simple set of electromagnets.  Tearing out the wires to the right of this terminal should interrupt their power supply, and gravity will do the rest.

Unfortunately, destroying the power conduit adjacent to this terminal will likely disable it, as well as a number of other terminals and pattern buffers in the vicinity.  You'll have to find another terminal that I can use to teleport you out.

In response to the status report request issued by the committee, Engineering Officer Fourth Class hereby submits a formal request ($C6?plea$C2) for the reclassification of the southern wing shafts of the mine.  The aforementioned reclassifications would close ~(902.1) sectors currently active under existing doctrine.  Engineer adds a further personal note that reclassification is long overdue for the southern wing, and that health hazards are currently significantly disrupting moral of mine crew.
