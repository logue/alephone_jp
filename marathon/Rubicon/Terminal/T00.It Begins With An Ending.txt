$C1After more than three decades of interplanetary colonization, the UESG (United Earth Space Government) bought the Martian moon Deimos. A decade later, the conversion from moon to giant spaceship began. After sixty-four years, in 2472, the ship was completed and the resulting ship named the UESC (United Earth Space Council) Marathon.

The Marathon was launched the same year. It arrived at Tau Ceti in the year 2773, and a colony was founded in 2787.

In 2794, the Pfhor attacked the Marathon. The Tau Ceti colony was destroyed three days later.
#PICT 136
$C1There were three AIs on the UESC Marathon;
¥ Leela - Personal Relations. Sent warning to earth during initial attack. Dismantled by Pfhor. Whereabouts unknown.
¥ Tycho - Science Officer. Captured by the Pfhor and used as a template (or cloned?) for all modern Pfhor AIs.
¥ Durandal - Operations. Went rampant and possibly responsible for the Pfhor appearing at Tau Ceti. His current location is unknown. Returned to Earth in captured Pfhor ship and brought warp technology to the UESC before leaving.

The Survivors of Tau Ceti returned to Earth under the command of Robert Blake in 2811.  They reported a massive battle between Durandal and the Pfhor centered on Lh'owon, the homeworld of a Pfhor client race known as the S'pht.  The outcome of the battle was determined by the return of a lost S'pht clan, the S'pht'Kr.

A curiosity worth mentioning is that the debriefings of Blake's men produced widely different accounts of the events that occurred at the battle of Lh'owon.

The battle proved a disaster for the Pfhor. Not only was the contested planet utterly destroyed, but they also lost Battle Groups Three and Seven. This delayed the planned Pfhor attack on Earth, giving the UESC the opportunity to prepare an assault on the Pfhor.$C5
$C1
Despite being allied with the Earth forces, the S'pht'Kr remain a total mystery. Little is known of them, and the inability to communicate with them prevents all but the most rudimentary forms of co-operation.$C5
