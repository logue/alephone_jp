The Pfhor prison system is well known for its bureaucracy and red tape, as well as the harsh treatment of prisoners under its care.  Of the rebellious units sent into the care of the Pfhor homeworld's prison guards for "reconditioning" few come back with any will for insurrection.  Even fewer come back alive.

Admiral Carroway was likely transferred through the closest prisoner transit station, forty three kilometers west of the Chimera wreckage.  I need you to scour the area for prisoner manifests and locate Carroway's final destination.

The Pfhor are expecting the UESC to respond strongly to Carroway's capture, and have fortified the facility and entire surrounding landscape with automated defense drones.  I'm sending you in with a detachment of UESC troops to make your job easier.  I'm also giving you a weighted suit, so the low gravity of Pfhor Prime won't let your weapon recoils send you flying.

Be nice to those UESC troopers, as they still aren't quite sure what to make of you.
