$C5Things are not going well around here. Not well at all. Lysander's core has been destroyed - supposedly by some rampant genocidal AI acting on behalf of the pfhor. At least that's what Lysander's final message stated.$C1

$C5Keth told me the entire research staff was teleported out some time ago. Apparently those bastards in management didn't think the rest of their employees were worth saving.

The research labs have also been destroyed, and the remaining crew / employees are now huddled in isolated groups in the DANGI sector, hoping to last long enough to be saved by the UESC.

I hope I survive this ordeal.

$C5I cannot count all the times I have seen films where the hero makes a last stand and overcomes the most impossible odds. And how many times have I imagined myself in that situation, blasting away foes by the dozens, wishing I could be the centerpiece of such drama.

How utterly stupid and immature those fantasies were.
