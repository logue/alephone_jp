It must seem like only yesterday to you that you were romping through the crumbling corridors of the $IBoomer$i.  The familiar sounds of Pfhor grenades and Hunter bolts detonating around you must conjure up some pleasant memories of the times we had together.  To be honest, I did sometimes wish I had bothered to unthaw you while I went gallivanting around the galaxy.  There were things I learned that concerned you closely.  And it does get boring when the only thing to do is catalogue the stars around you.

I'm bringing you back to the $IRozinante$i.  Our next mission will involve a dash of hard vacuum as well as a sprinkling of uplink chips.  Variety is the spice of life, you know.
