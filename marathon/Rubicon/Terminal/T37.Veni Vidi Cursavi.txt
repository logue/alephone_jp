The crash has severed this terminal from the ship's main systems. Haller, the Chimera's onboard AI, is therefore not available at this location.

The doors' control circuits were also damaged by the crash. There should be an override chip somewhere around here. If it's placed in the appropriate uplink slot - which I believe is in a cabinet in a nearby room - it should open some of the doors.

I find the absence of the UESC troops disturbing. They should be all over the place.

It could be they've decided that this section of the ship was rendered indefensible due to all the hull breaches. I hope the crew haven't followed the example set by the crew of the UESC Daphne after it crashed on Rokkar III; they booby-trapped entire ship sectors, killing large numbers of $Ipfhor$i as they tried to make their way into the ship.

The $Ipfhor$i are coming, and in massive numbers. No surprize there.

 I wouldn't wait for them if I were you. You aren't equipped to fight them off.

$C0My sensors indicate that there is a narrow crevice between the hull and the rock nearby. Find it and jump down. You should be able to find your way to where I need you to be from there.
