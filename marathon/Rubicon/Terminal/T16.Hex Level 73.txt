My original motivations for fighting alongside the UESC in this epic war was to insure the fall of the Pfhor empire.  The humans are relative newcomers to intergalactic warfare, and defeating a seasoned race like the Pfhor has been no day at the beach for Admiral Carroway and his fleets.  Even with the help of the $IS'pht'Kr$i combined with the sheer tactical genius that the Admiral possesses, the UESC still stands an unacceptably high chance of $Ifailure.$i

I had originally hoped to turn the tide of the war in one swift swing of my sword, but Carroway's death and Tycho's subsequent reappearance have complicated things needlessly.

The destruction of this Tycho clone should be more than enough to swing the balance of power safely back in the UESC's hands.

The fuse box you need to sever to disable Tycho's power circuit is somewhere in the upper section of the main power line conduit.  The entrance is blocked by two power rods, but they can be raised simply by flipping the switches at their base, as per the diagram to the left.

You can get there by taking the door right behind this terminal and turning left and going up the stairs.

When both switches are flipped, come back here for further instructions.
