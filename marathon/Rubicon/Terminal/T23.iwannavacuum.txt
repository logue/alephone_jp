When the Pfhor entered this satellite, they must have done so through the hull.  This entire complex is open to the vacuum of space.

Perhaps more pertinent to the matter at hand is the fact that the virus uplink chip we're looking for is almost certainly somewhere on this satellite, although I'm not sure where.

Unfortunately for us, when Dangi built this orbital structure - or small space station, to be more accurate - they installed a ridiculous amount of security bypasses to prevent unauthorized access.  This puts roughly half the station out of your reach.

However, there is a structural flaw in one of the rooms which you can access, as detailed in the diagram to the left.  I've equipped you with a small explosive for this mission; place it where I've indicated.  It should blast open the wall, letting you enter the section of the station that is currently off limits.

I'm confident we will find what we're looking for here.  Leave no stone unturned.

Time has run out for the Pfhor.  Their fleet is in shambles, their ships are unable to communicate, and the Achilles data is safely in our hands.

The following level is dedicated to all those players who complained about the nonlinearity of Rubicon's levels after the original release - that they didn't know where to go and kept getting lost.

All you have to do is stay on the dotted line.  ;)
