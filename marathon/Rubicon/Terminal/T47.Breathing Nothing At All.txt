#$bbegin entry 1 of 7

$C5three years i have worked on this station in the same position, doing the same labor, following the same rules.  until only a few days ago, i had been complacent in my role: to win the war the uesc needs soldiers.  some soldiers fight with their steady hands or quick reflexes, others fight with their minds.  i have fought the war against the pfhor with every neuron that my brain could spare; immaculately following each instruction my superiors gave me, working to produce a weapon i did not understand.

$C5i finally know the true depth of my folly, and to humanity i owe an apology i can't possibly make.  it is my hope that whoever reads this will act upon it, and their action will be my penance.

i have spread the vile secrets of this place over six other terminals.  find them and you will know the truth.

according to documents i extracted from a damaged terminal within the archive node, the salinger's development dates back to pre-war days.  while the documents were unclear as to the exact date, they did specify the list of involved men and corporations.  the classified files in the uesc wing will tell you that the salinger was built by the dangi corporation.  what you won't learn there is that /there is no/ dangi corporation.  the company is a hollow shell, a holding structure for the combined wealth of the ten most powerful men in the pre-war economy.

i can only assume that these ten men took for granted their success in the business world and decided to raise the bar of their influence.  the very existence of powerful industrialists in our society necessitates the fear that one day there will be no more foreign markets for them to conquer, that one day ten trillion credits and fifteen trillion credits will look no different in their eyes.

it should have been obvious to those who could stand against them that their final horizon is complete and utter control.  by now it may be too late.

no uesc or dangi employee has ever been allowed to view the project the salinger is dedicated to producing as a whole, nor is any employee permitted to view the command structure that this station operates under.  i accepted this as a necessary evil when i first joined the ranks... we are at war, and secrecy is a powerful ally.

only through careful examinations of communication logs have i been able to gain any information about the operational details of the salinger.  what follows is the best description of the chain of command that i can provide.

under the watchful eye of 'the committee,' tasks and workers are assigned and reassigned.  everyone is kept moving from task to task and position to position, even the sacred few who know the truth.  at times, all work on a task is deserted only to be resumed in mid stride by a patchwork team transferred from any number of sectors away.

this sweeping of the staff... a "disinformation shift" as 'the committee' calls it, is designed to keep everyone from having lasting friendships that may undermine loyalty to dangi or foster discussions that question its motives.

everyone i pass in the halls has the same glassy look to their eyes.  they all learn and forget names in the blink of an eye, stepping to the beat of each disinformation shift.  it is in this way that the directors have prevented anyone from discovering the true purpose of this station.

only a handful of people know the second dirtiest secret of this station, a secret many men have given their lives to protect.
while it may not outwardly seem true, all work on the salinger is geared towards the development of a cure for a manmade virus named "achilles."  i don't know when the achilles virus was developed or by whom, but i've seen first hand what it does to test patients.

a high level scientist working on the virus once described to me its probable post-release impact on humanity as an 'extinction level event.'  i believe him.

the ten men in control of dangi intend to use the virus and the cure as a form of massive blackmail.  they want absolute control of uesc government, something the achilles virus would grant them with ease.

to provide a continual supply of 'volunteers' for achilles test vaccines and to delay the inevitable uesc victory in the war, certain dangi controllers participate in a covert trafficking ring with the pfhor.  in exchange for uesc weapons and secrets, the pfhor offload human pows by the shipload into the salinger's upper decks.

to avoid any risk of discovery, all men are kept in stasis during the exchange and offloading process.  at a later time, the controllers arrange for the removal of each man's vocal chords.  as speechless inmates of the salinger, these ex uesc pows await their day to be exposed to the virus.  the men are kept in corridors of single cells that stretch the length of the ship like a beehive.  i have walked these halls and heard ten thousand teeth chattering from fear.  i assure you, it is the most disturbing noise a human can experience.
