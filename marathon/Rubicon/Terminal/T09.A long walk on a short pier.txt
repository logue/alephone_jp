I hope you're enjoying the effects of low gravity and vacuum on combat maneuvering, I know I am.  I haven't been this entertained by your $Iballet de sang$i since you went G4 sunbathing on the $IMarathon.$i

The circuits that need to be destroyed in order to bring down the magnetic field are on the aft starboard side of the ship - not far from where you came out. Their protective covering can be disabled down by flipping a switch on the port side of the ship. This switch is also concealed by a protective cover, but you should be able to open that without too much trouble.

Once you've ripped out the circuits, go to the bow and I'll try to bring you back home.

Good luck.
