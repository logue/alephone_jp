How are we feeling today?  Drowsy, manipulated and confused?  Good.  You should be used to that by now.  Wipe the sleep out of those eyes, replace that empty clip, and listen up.  I don’t have time to play games.
#PICT 100
You've been in the cozy confines of an ill-proportioned Pfhor stasis chamber for about five decades here on board the $IRozinante$i, and things have changed quite a bit since you were gleefully romping around on the surface of Lh'owon.

I could entertain you with a witty and insightful account of the events of the past 49 years, but we don't have the time to squander.  Suffice it to say, the Pfhor have been involved in a bitter war with the UESC since shortly after the end of your last adventure.  It's been a pretty even fight so far.

We're here to tip the scales.$C3
