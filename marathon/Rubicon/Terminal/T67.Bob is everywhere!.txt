The initial release of Rubicon was accompanied by "Rubicon Aleph Light" - which was basically Rubicon accompanied by an early version of AO - and a promise to release a "full" Rubicon AO at some later point.

But work on "Rubicon  AO" - or "Rubicon X" as it is called now - soon faltered and was reduced to the occasional handful of texture upgrades or level tweak. RX was more or less dead at one point, and all work had stopped.

It would have remained that way if $C4Steve Levinson$C7 hadn't brought it back to life with his "A change in strategy" email.

But Real Life kept interfering with the other contributors and pretty soon my part was pretty much limited to waiting for them to cough up the occasional texture. In the spring of 2005 they bowed out. They just did not have the time to work on RX, and I was the only one left.

This should have been the end of RX, but recognizing that this was a solo project actually increased the development rate; I no longer had to wait for anybody else's input and could work at my own pace.

Hope you've enjoyed the new and improved Rubicon.

One more thing...

When the various line of sight limits were removed in Aleph One, I just $Ihad$i to make a map that explored the new possibilities. The resulting level was rather mediocre and I've since made other and better "long view levels", but I decided to include it in case somebody was interested.

That's where you're heading now. If you don't want to see this "because I could" level, hit ESC. Otherwise...
