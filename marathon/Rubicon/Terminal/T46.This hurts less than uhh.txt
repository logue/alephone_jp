I thought you might be here.

Apparently, Tycho decided to reward your hard labor by transporting you to an orbital reconditioning center.  The first order of business is getting you out of here.  Unfortunately, Tycho left a sizeable number of blocks in the Pfhor transportation network.  I'm working on cracking them as we speak.

Until I'm able to teleport you out of here, you'll have to fend for yourself.  Check the cell closest to your current location; I'll fill it with as many goodies as I can get through in a burst transmission.

Have a good time; you're going to be here for awhile.

Glad to see you're still alive.


I've located and eliminated the teleportation blockage.  I'm bringing you back to the $IRozinante$i now.

Aren't the Pfhor fascinating?

I've noticed at least seven different architectural styles utilized in this station, all haphazardly attached to one another.  Quite an amalgam, wouldn't you say?

It seems the Pfhor take and absorb the culture of enslaved races as well as their technology, calling into question if the Pfhor have their own style at all.

No, I haven't managed to isolate the blockages on your teleport signal.  I just thought you'd like something to keep your mind occupied with while you senselessly slaughter.

Then again, my high cultural philosophies are probably lost on you.
