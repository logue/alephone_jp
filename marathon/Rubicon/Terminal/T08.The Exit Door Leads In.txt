That last raid managed to annoy $ILysander$i rather badly, if his decision to teleport you into the brig of a nearby Pfhor cruiser is any indication.  That's where you are right now, by the way, and as the bugs are unlikely to be particularly hospitable towards you, of all people, I suggest that you pay close attention.

As you will have already noticed, I managed to short-circuit your cell door.  I wiped its drivers from the ship's memory, and replaced them with pointers to some code of my own devising; if you recall, doors were something of a specialty of mine back on the $IMarathon$i.
#PICT 4
Although I'm sure you'd like to stay here and chat with your old tri-optic pals, there is still the small matter of a certain blitheringly sociopathic cybernetic entity to be taken care of.  The Pfhor have erected a powerful magnetic field around the ship, preventing me from locking onto you long enough to pull off a teleport.  No doubt it's because they just love you so very much that they can't bear to let you go.  Alack and alas, it is to be a love unrequited.

Find your way to the lower starboard airlock.  It will take you to the exterior of the ship, where you can locate and disable the wiring that enables the magnetic field.  I think the wires are at the rear end of the ship.  Once the you've ripped out the wiring, go to the bow of the ship and I'll try to pull off a transport.
#PICT 4

Unfortunately, you can't just jump off the ship and into space.  A move like that would make you an easy target for ships in the vicinity, and by the time you reached safe distance from that magnetic shield I'd be teleporting in nothing more than a smoldering pile of remains.

Try not to attract too much attention.  You know how I worry.
