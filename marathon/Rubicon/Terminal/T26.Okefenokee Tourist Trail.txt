Tycho's movement on the Pfhor grid is kept in check by a series of hardwired control circuits located in this area.  The lockout mechanism preventing Tycho from seizing control of the entire Pfhor Prime network is skillfully engineered so that he cannot access the software which restricts his movement due to the hardwired circuits in the mechanism.
#PICT 312



You need to expose and destroy these three key circuits around the outside of the circular lockout mechanism.  I've teleported several S'pht compilers into the area so that they may work to remove the software barriers once you have destroyed the hardware ones.  Although I'm sure you wouldn't dream of shooting anything that isn't attacking you, I know how you bipeds can get a little trigger happy in the heat of battle.  In any case, don't hurt the compilers.  I need them alive to finish the job.

Tycho has already let me know that he now has a little more breathing room.  He also sends you his warmest regards, and hopes that there aren't any hard feelings left over from the days of the $IMarathon$i.  

I told him that he was melodramatic and should leave you to what you do best.
#PICT 4


You don't like him better than you like me, do you?


Nevermind.

Our next little errand will be to locate a data-modification and expansion chip that will allow Tycho to replicate and expand over the Pfhor network.  You should be a pretty good swimmer by now, so get ready to put those talents to good use.
