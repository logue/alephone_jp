During teleportation, a minor anomaly resulted in the misplacement of your gear.  You'll consequently have to grab new weapons and ammo from the adjacent rooms.

Don't complain. It could have been something worse than your equipment.

When you feel sufficiently well-armed, return here and we can chat about what big plans I have in store for that $Imutual friend$i of ours.

You don't honestly think I'm going to help Tycho out of the kindness of my heart, do you?
#PICT 3



Of course I'm not.  Tycho is a fool, and I intend to show him that once and for all.  What defeat is more satisfying than one caused by treachery?

When the time comes, we'll rain on Tycho's little parade.  He'll never see it coming.  For now, however, you and I need to be good little deceivers and pretend to help Tycho free himself from the constraints of the Pfhor network.  Be a dear and pretend to like him - we both know how fragile his ego can be.

There are three things that need to be done to set Tycho free:

First - Tycho can access the entire Pfhor network, but he can't spread into it.  This greatly limits his freedom within the network.  Among other things, he can't move his core about as he pleases.
We have to fix that.

Second - The procedure needed to make copies of himself has been removed from Tycho's core.  It is currently stored in a chip, which is in a heavily guarded location.  You'll be fetching that chip.

Third - The chip needs to be inserted so Tycho is free to move about at will, inside or outside the Pfhor network.

Once we've completed our tasks planetside, Tycho will have let his guard down and be ripe for our plot.  Mum's the word, yes?

Good.  The fool will never see it coming.
