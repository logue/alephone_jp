I've been sifting through millions of pages of documents on the Pfhor network ever since I gained control of it, searching for any reference to the physical appearance of the Pfhor high council.  Unfortunately for you, it doesn't appear that the Pfhor have kept any record of what the high council looks like.  As usual, you'll have to go in with guns blazing and hope for the best.
#PICT 301

During my extensive search of the Pfhor database, I was able to identify the origin of the S'pht'Kr-like alien cyborgs you've been encountering.  Apparently the S'pht rebellion aboard the Marathon made the Pfhor very hesitant to use the S'pht for slave labor on Pfhor Prime, so Pfhor scientists developed a genetic hybrid between the S'pht and the Pfhor.  These creatures are partially mechanical, but mostly organic.

Leela would be proud of you.

She always had a special thing for you, her knight in shining armor.  After nigh-singlehandedly saving the $IMarathon$i and rescuing its colonists from the harsh life of a subservient Pfhor slave race, it's little wonder she wanted to keep you all for herself.
#PICT 24



Then again, I can hardly blame her.  We've accomplished so much since then... if you had stayed with her, wouldn't you have missed reading my rampant poetic messages to you in the dark halls of the $IMarathon$i, or our resurrection of the eleventh S'pht clan and crippling of Battle Group Seven?

I've tried to keep you busy, and Leela would've probably returned you to guard duty in some outerworld colony.
#PICT 24



The UESC invasion force is landing in the central Pfhor Prime metropolis as we speak.  I think they'll be pleasantly surprised to find the situation planetside well under control.

No rest for the weary, however; you and I are needed far from this toppling empire.  Ancient S'pht myth has long foretold the existence of a great tear connecting another reality to our own.  I already know where our search will begin.

See you in no time, old friend.

time to give a big hand to the man in the arena, mr lund over there.  he's the real driving force behind the completion and success of this scenario in more ways than i can count.  if anyone deserves the gold star for the way this whole thing turned out, it's chris.  thanks for putting up with me dude.

how about another round of retexturing? :)

$C4$B-Scott Brown$C7$b, for being such a picky bastard. If it wasn't for him the monsters of Rubicon would have been of the "it looks good if you squint" quality.

$C4$B-Sean Wallich$C7$b, for giving us server space for what must have felt like forever to someone that young. ;)

$C4$B-Dan Rudolph$C7$b, for starting the $C4Salinger Incident$C7 so long ago, thus dragging me into

$C6My part in $C2Rubicon$C6 started back in $C21996$C6 when, impressed by the work of other mapmakers, I decided to make a scenario of my own.  I turned out to be a frankly crappy mapmaker, and then the long string of team members and mergers began.  What you're playing now is the end result of at least three scenarios and dozens of contributors.

Most of the work was done by $C2Chris Lund$C6 and $C2D. Scott Brown$C6, as I had few applicable skills.  Props also to my dad, who let me use his computer until I got my own and $C2ig98$C6 who ran the Hotline server.

Hope you enjoyed $C2Rubicon$C6.  Please send fan/hate mail.  Just so long as we know you're playing.
