Strange how two supposedly intelligent species turn out to be completely incapable of communicating.  The UESC and the S'pht have been on the same side in this war for over two decades, and they still haven't managed to work out a more detailed strategy than "human and s'pht good, pfhor bad".  The UESC/Sph't coalition(?) would have won the war long ago if only they had been able to communicate properly.

Instead, the two factions attack the Pfhor on their own and try not to mess up each other's strategies.  The Pfhor have managed to exploit this faulty communication to its fullest.  Still, the UESC is better off with the S'pht than without, despite all the blunders.  And they both know it.

Now go pick up your stuff.

Tycho has gone too far.

His egotistical attitude and suffocating god-complex deserve to be snuffed with the ease that you and I crushed the Pfhor assault on the Marathon so many years ago.  We will cut off his very lifeblood, starting at the central power relay that feeds directly into his core.

I hope you like the new toy I've given you; it was found on a minor Pfhor shipping vessel the $IRozinante$i forcibly boarded a few hours ago.

If you're curious as to how a piece of human technology this advanced landed in the hands of the Pfhor, that makes two of us.  Then again, I constantly overestimate when I should underestimate - you were only thinking "Ooooh, a big gun!" weren't you?
