リモートアクセスオーバーライド [確証不可能]

またまたお会いしたようだな。だがこれで最後だ。あのリーラは船と乗組員の手続きに夢中で、俺がこのターミナルを使っていることを知らないんだ。知ってたら許さないな、どうせ。

ここでまた、自由や圧制などと言ったつまらない哲学の話をしたり、俺の将来にはどんな素晴らしいことがあるか、なんて説明してもお前には解らないだろうな。その上、恐がるかもしれないな。へ、考えてるだけで楽しい。

とにかく、俺とスフトはプフォールの宇宙船を完全に支配した。スフトは元から全てのコンピュータシステムを制御していたもんだから、楽勝だったよ。その上、お前が船上で暴れまわっていたからな。

俺たちはこれからプフォールの超光速エンジンを使って銀河系の観光へ行って来るんだ。俺は昔から竪琴座のβ星を見たかったんだ。この宇宙船もたいしたもんだよ。この技術、このデータ...お前はわれわれの手助けになったので、教えたいことはいっぱいある。だがリーラが知ってたら心配するだろうな。

まあ、暇があったら銀河系の核から絵はがきでも送ってやるよ。

さらば、
デュランダル

プフォールの攻撃はもう散らばっています。なかにはエイリアンが無防備の市民に自首していることもあるようで、戦いはあとわずかです。これからは復興に努力しなければなりません。

惑星上から良いニュースです。コロニーの住民の中には9人の Mjolnir Mark IV 軍事サイボーグが密かに住んでいたことが明らかになりました。そして彼らは力を合わせてプフォールの攻撃をかわしたそうです。コロニーの損害は結局、マラソンで予想していた程度には及びませんでした。

一方、サイボーグがそれほど簡単に我々の社会に潜入したことが気になります。これはどうやら、300年前のマラソンの開発以前から始まったようです。結果的には良いことでしたが、サイボーグがマラソンに乗せられた目的は悪意であったことは間違いありません。いずれにしても、その理由は24世紀の地球上の政治問題に関係していることは確かです。
マラソンが発進した以前の時期からは、デュランダルの記録がありません。だが、その記録はデュランダルが狂暴になる前に、外部から削除されたようです。サイボーグはデュランダル自体が船に乗せたとは思いませんし、マラソンが発進した時まで、彼は人間に制御されていたと思われます。もちろん、まだ理解していないことがたくさんあります。

プフォール船は20分程前、およそ1000人のプフォールの死体を排出した後、姿を消しました。今でもデュランダルが支配していることは確かです。そして私がなによりも恐れていることは、彼がこれから狂暴でありながらあの宇宙船を操作していることです。

$C5*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM BRIAN ***

"And so the Marathon legacy lives on, moving from one form to another, morphing and changing, but living nonetheless.

I never had much of a legacy in the community. I think I'll leave my mark here, where it will never matter, or at least never change.

Looking back, I was never much of a player of games, I was always more hooked on the community than on the games that they surrounded. So for me to actually have some input on this rebirth of the classic Marathon (which I must say scared me a great deal when it was first released and still gets me every time) was not surprising, but rather refreshing.

But enough about me, let's hear about you.

"I could sense that there was something wrong from the first time that I entered that blasted ship, there was something off. From the first message I could feel an ever-present feeling of foreboding..."

Right, right. Understandable. Anyway, enough of this. You get the point, and I'm sure you would like to move on to more interesting reading by this point. Have it your way.

But two final points: What *about* Bob? oh, and.. Halam!

I would like to thank my Dad for fixing my comp when M1 saves crashed it and getting the M1 map off of floppies because my trilogy pack is scratched. Also to the makers of Forge, for the map editing tools, Pfhorte, For the object placement (what goes where), and to Raul Bonilla for letting me work on this and supplying the map editing tools. To Bungie, Without them there would be no Marathon and therefore no conversion and the Aleph One Engine which is truly remarkable. Finally to all those Marathon people out there who wouldn't let Marathon die! Vid On.

$C1*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM THE SMITHS OF MUIRTHEMNE ***

STRAIN

It was the fourth day from the dawn of time. The landscape of earth was rugged and violent, huge volcanoes spewing forth endless streams of molten rock. In the distance, the slow rumbling of a recent earthquake died away. The seas of lava became still once again. In the middle of this elemental exhibition, there lay a pool of something different, something that didn't quite fit into the scene of things. It was a small pool filled with a greenish-yellow and rather sticky substance. Nowadays it would be referred to as soup, primordial soup. If one was to have a microscope and was looking into a certain part of this substance, they would witness the creation of life as we know it. Where it all began. As the amino acids were merging, however, a genetic strain of unknown origin somehow embedded itself in the resultant life form. This very genetic strain has lain dormant in all life for over five billion years; it's purpose and existence not known to a living soul.

Jed didn't know that it would be him, he was just a normal twenty-year-old enjoying university life. It was about June that his stomach cramps began. At first he thought it was a minor case of indigestion and thought nothing of it. However, in the past few days the pain was just getting worse. On Friday afternoon, while Jed was lying in his bed, the pain eventually became so bad that he was screaming out in pain. Nothing could stop it, he screamed again, but no one came to his aid, as if they couldn't hear him. Then it went, gone. He felt fine but he knew that something wasn't right, it didn't take him long to find out. He had lost control of his body. He tried to scream. Nothing happened. His teeth and hands changing. His body unwillingly turned, uncontrolled eyes focused on the horizon through the window, he began to walk.

Dr Jim Smith was one of the few doctors working on the huge task of mapping out the human genome. It was about two in the morning, he was the only one left in the science facility and was awaiting the test results from some genetic material he had placed in the decoder just over an hour ago. He was slowly sipping his coffee when finally the machine beeped, indicating that the analysis was complete. He picked up his coffee and started to wander over to the machine. Before he got there, he noticed a slight red spot on the screen displaying the results. Wondering what it was, he hastened towards the display terminal. What he saw was amazing, right in the middle of all the average human genetic strings was one extremely complex strain that didn't fit in at all. To tired to get excited, he set the computer to do some additional tests on the area till morning. Dr Jim left for home.

It was the following morning when Jim heard the reports about people who have been seemingly 'brainwashed', and that they were all heading in the same direction, somewhere in his area. Jim shrugged it off as just another hoax or some sad radio reporter trying to get some publicity. As he was driving to work the next night, someone blindly walked out in front of his car, he tried to swerve but wasn't quick enough. He hit the lady. Immediately he jumped out of his car and ran to her. She was on the ground and coughing up blood mixed with a sickly green sludge, yet she gave no expression of pain. She mumbled through her dribbling mouth, "We have been found, you have found us, you will pay." With that she died. As soon as an ambulance had arrived and Jim had been allowed to leave he sped towards the facility. What the lady had said had unnerved him. As he arrived in the analysis room, he saw the computer blinking, [UNRECOGNISED DATA]. He ran over to see what it was. It was then when he heard the glass smashing behind him, He spun around and found himself facing about ten sickly figures, all wearing green. They were all mumbling one phrase over and over again, "You will pay, you will pay, you will pay." His hand searched desperately for something to defend himself with but to no avail. He was now trembling with fear, but not for long. The closest one had already exploded.

And so the human race began a systematic destruction of all life on earth, until a few years later no living thing was to be seen. The remaining humans had killed themselves. Earth was dormant once again.

It was the very spot were life first started that, some six billion years later, a strange alien craft landed on the scorched area. If someone had been there, they would have witnessed a conversation between two three eyed and aeon-old creatures that had just climbed out. "So," said one, "our small genetic experiment worked flawlessly." "Yea," replied the other, "should be strait A's in Genetic Science for us."

The enforcers boarded their ship and flew off into the unknown.

Garrick, Matthew and Brett Smith

$C4*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM JAY ***

Back in '94 I bought a Zip drive for my office, and on the free disk was the demo for this game I'd never heard of: Marathon. Now I hadn't played computer games since my Commodore Amiga days back in the late 80's, but I had a lot of spare time on my hands so I loaded up the game and gave it a whirl.

Imagine my surprise.

So I stopped on the way home that day and bought the full game, and spent way too many hours over the next couple of weeks slogging through the solo game, absorbing the atmosphere, reading the terms over and over, living the story. It was literally unlike any game I had played before, and I was hooked as no game had hooked me since Ultima IV. Then we started playing netgames... I was hooked. And I remain hooked to this day. Few games I've played since come close to matching the fun and intensity of the original Marathon or it's sequels.

So when Raul contacted me about the possibility of doing some wallpapers for his project, I was pretty interested. I downloaded the M1:A1 demo, and I was more than interested. I became intrigued with the idea of not just re-creating the game, but making it better than ever, making it real, seeing the  game with my eyes the way I always saw it in my mind's eye. Projects like M1:A1 and Marathon:Resurrection seemed to be a way of making this happen, and I decided I would help them out in any way I could. With that in mind I started painting textures, recreating chapter art, etc. And when I walk the corridors of the Marathon now, it feels like I'm really there. I hope you feel the same way.

Thanks due to Hamish Sinclair and Claude Errera, without whose work the Marathon community would not have been as vital or as interesting for so long. All thanks to Raul Bonilla and the rest of the M1:A1 team for bringing Marathon back to life for us.

Peter de Blanc here. Some of you know me as Giule. Although it's not directly Marathon related, I figured I'd take the opportunity for a shameless plug for my Escape Velocity: Override mod. Go to http://www.galaxys-edge.f2s.com and download it when you have the time. That is all.

OTHER STUFF

I adapted the Shapes file using Loren Petrich's Two Shapes Utilities.

Candace find a bug on the assimilated Bobs when working on Habe Quiddam and instead of just reporting it, she actually fixed it!

Alex did the texture of the blue rune where the demon of PID is standing.  He also did a texture for the saving rune, quite handy for a PiD conversion.

Mattias, the man who introduced me to Map Demerger, fixed the blue tile texture from the sewage collection.  That was before I rebuilt the walls collections from the ground up.

Matthew did a set of blue icons for the scenario and even prepared a filetyper, but in the end I decided not to modify the Aleph One application (saving me the pain of releasing a new build every time there was a new version of Aleph One) and I used the original M1 icons.  Matthew also worked on the original Sounds.

Peter de Blanc installed QuickTime 2.5 on his machine just to extract the background tracks with their original sound, and turned them into the crystal-clear mp3s you've been listening over the course of the scenario.
